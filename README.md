# Contextulizer
## What's new in `DEV-20160907`
Contextulizer has not been active in a while. Looking at this project with a fresh perspective has led me to change the direction
of this project. Here are the new details.
### (New) Description
Contextulizer sorts files by user-defined categories. There are a few default categories, which vary by distribution.<br>
Contextulizer's ultimate goal is to sort files by algorithms, but the primary goal is to be a sorting tool.
### User Interface
The UI is, at this point, command-line only. To access the category editor right now, you drop a file called `interface.txt`<br>
on to Contextulizer. This is likely to change in the near future.
### Version Naming Conventions
Contextulizer is currently in the Development, or `Dev`, phase. There are no "releases", only builds, which are defined in:<br>
`DEV-YYYYDDMM`. In the Alpha/Beta/Release phases, this will be `major.minor(.build)`.
### API
The API is **Shelved**. This means that active development has stopped, existing features are to be removed, and for<br> it
to possibly be reintroduced in the future.
### C++ Integration
This feature was planned early on, and was a terrible idea. All plans for this have been **Removed**
## Wiki?
GitHub offers a nice Wiki feature, as development progresses a wiki will be put in. In so early development one is unnessesary.
